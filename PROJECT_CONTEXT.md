# 🎮 EduBattle - Project Context & Background

## 📋 **Project Overview**

**EduBattle** is an innovative educational lane battle game that combines tower defense mechanics with quiz-based learning. Players deploy warrior squads by answering educational questions across multiple subjects (Math, Science, History, Language), creating an engaging way to learn while gaming.

## 🤖 **AI-Generated Codebase**

**Important Context**: This codebase was **NOT manually coded by our team**. Instead, it was generated by **Ohara**, a no-code AI platform that creates full-stack applications based on prompts and requirements.

### 🛠️ **Our Development Approach**

We describe our development process as **"vibecoding our way through"** - which means:

- ✅ **Starting Point**: Complete codebase generated by Ohara AI
- ✅ **Our Role**: Understanding, modifying, and enhancing the AI-generated code
- ✅ **Learning Process**: Reverse-engineering the AI's architecture and logic
- ✅ **Customizations**: Adding new features and fixing issues through code modifications
- ✅ **Problem Solving**: Debugging and improving the generated system

## 🏆 **Ideathon Context**

This project is being developed for an **ideathon competition** where:

- **Ohara AI platform** was the **official suggestion** from organizers
- Participants were encouraged to use AI-generated codebases as starting points
- The focus is on **innovation and enhancement** rather than coding from scratch
- Our team's value-add comes from **understanding, customizing, and improving** the AI output

## 🎯 **Current Game Features**

- **Squad-Based Combat**: Deploy groups of 2-4 units instead of single units
- **Quiz-Driven Gameplay**: Answer educational questions to deploy warrior squads
- **Performance-Based Mechanics**: Correct answers = stronger squads, wrong answers = weakened squads
- **Multi-Subject Learning**: Math Knights, Science Mages, History Archers, Language units
- **Real-Time Strategy**: Lane battle mechanics with spell casting and base destruction
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Weighted probability system for squad sizes

## 🔧 **Technical Stack**

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with React 19
- **Game Engine**: Phaser.js 3.90 with Matter.js physics
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Vercel-ready configuration

## 📚 **Educational Content**

- **Math**: Arithmetic, algebra, geometry problems
- **Science**: Chemistry, biology, physics concepts
- **History**: Philippine and world history questions
- **Language**: Grammar, vocabulary, spelling challenges

## 🚀 **Our Contributions & Enhancements**

Since receiving the AI-generated codebase, we have:

### ✅ **Completed Modifications**

1. **Squad Deployment System**: Enhanced single-unit deployment to squad-based (2-4 units)
2. **Weighted Probability**: Implemented 60%/30%/10% distribution for squad sizes
3. **Always-Deploy Mechanic**: Units always deploy regardless of quiz answers (with penalties)
4. **Formation Positioning**: Units spawn in tactical formations instead of stacked
5. **Separate Timers**: Independent deployment timers for player and enemy forces
6. **UI/UX Improvements**: Disabled manual unit buttons, updated tutorial text
7. **Camera Controls**: Added grab/grabbing cursor styles for intuitive panning
8. **Debug System**: Comprehensive logging for deployment tracking

### 🎮 **Game Balance Improvements**

- **Player Advantage**: Quiz-based deployment with skill rewards
- **Enemy AI**: Consistent deployment patterns for fair challenge
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of correct vs incorrect answer consequences
- **Formation Strategy**: Squad positioning adds tactical depth

## 💡 **Philosophy: "Vibecoding"**

Our approach represents a new paradigm in development:

- **AI as Foundation**: Leveraging AI-generated architecture and logic
- **Human Enhancement**: Adding creativity, problem-solving, and domain expertise
- **Iterative Improvement**: Understanding → Modifying → Testing → Enhancing
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Human insight + AI capability = Better outcomes

## 🎯 **Ideathon Goals**

1. **Demonstrate AI-Enhanced Development**: Show how teams can effectively build on AI-generated code
2. **Educational Innovation**: Create engaging learning experiences through gamification
3. **Technical Excellence**: Improve and optimize the AI-generated foundation
4. **User Experience**: Focus on intuitive, enjoyable educational gameplay

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

- **Multiplayer Support**: Real-time battles between human players
- **Leaderboards**: Competitive learning rankings
- **Custom Quizzes**: Teacher-created content integration
- **Achievement System**: Progress tracking and rewards
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly controls and responsive design
